# Thailand

Very busy and popular country. Full with tourism and attractions. It is a chaotic but beautiful environment filled with super friendly people, amazing food and fun all around. From street markets, temples, parks, malls, santuaries and floating markets to airplane cementeries, treks and incredible scenery; anyone can find something exciting to do in this beautiful country.

## General information about Thailand

- The details listed in [Asia README](https://github.com/rocajuanma/travel-tips/tree/master/asia) are very relevant and important to keep in mind.
- The country is very safe, traffic is crazy and they drive on the other side of the road so be careful while crossing the street, walking, biking or if you are brave enough; while driving.
- Food is super cheap and extremely tasty. You can find pad thai's at markets for $2 and other dishes that are equally tasty. There are lots of restaurants that vary in price and options so there is something for everyone regardless of dietary restrictions.
- I had some issues with ATMs there, but if you face some problems withdrawing money, just try a different 'color' ATM. These ATMs are afiliated to different organizations, only some of them work with international cards.
- Most day-trips can be found in any tourist information centre or store. The majority of them included pickup and dropoffs from your hotel, and meals. Make sure to ask for all these when booking one. Always try to negotiate the prices and if possible, compare a few options.

## Bangkok
Bangkok is definitely a chaotic beauty. Traffic, lots of people and tourists everywhere, so many fun places to visit and always the classic tuktuk ride to jump on. Expect to hit traffic when taking the taxi at any hours of the day, its unavoidable.

### Attractions
- **Chatuchak Weekend Market**
  One of the biggest markets in Bangkok. You can find everything and anything in this market. This is a *weekend* market only, but you can also visit it on Friday night if you are interested in buying in bulk. On Friday's, only a section of the market is open. Bring water and confortable shoes, you'll walk a lot! This weekend market is the best place to buy stuff, its the cheapest and best quality.
- **Khaosan Road** 
  The backpacker's heaven; full of stores, tattoo shops, hostels, bars and clubs. This area changes drastically from day to night. Definitely worth checking out during both times. At night, it becomes atreet full of nightclubs with very loud music and other vendors, itsa surreal experience and should definitely be explored.
- Airplace Cementery, part of a walking tour and a hidden attraction.
- **Floating Markets**
  There are several in Bangkok, I went to one in the north that you can get to by car. Some other markets you can only get by boat. You can buy local food and treats. The market also provides options for boat rides that are very fun. 
  ***IMPORTANT NOTE***: Some Taxi drivers offer a "floating market tour". Its a decent option, but be aware that this means the driver will take you to a "boat port" and you will be offered a very overpriced "floating market" boat tour. Negotiate heavily, otherwise its not worth it. Some people fall for this scam and end up paying for a very over priced experience.
- **Grand Palance** 
   Definitely worth the time. The Grand Palace tour includes several temples in the Grand Palace area. Dress appropriately, no shorts or tank tops. Always wear pants and have your shoulders covered, otherwise you might be refused entry. 
  ***IMPORTANT NOTE***: Tuktuk drivers offer a "tour" for a very affordable price, it includes all the major temples. They drive you around and wait for yopu to visit the temple before going to the next one. Its worth it, however, this "tour" ALWAYS includes a **local Tailor shop visit**, be very careful about this because the shop attendance are very pushy about selling you something, if you can avoid this stop alltogether. The tuktuk driver will insist on the stop, but my suggestion is to continue to refuse and move onto the next temple.
- **Soi Cowboy,** Bangkok's red light district. 


## Chiang Mai
This city was extremely beautiful and full of adventure-like tours. Chiang Mai is a more relaxed and rural town, full of delicious northern dishes, quiet streets and temples to explore. The old town is full of history and places to visit. It has great restaurants and plenty of bars. Massage parlours on every corner with great service for a reasonable price. Getting a Thai Massage(a real massage, not what you are thinking) in one of these places is definitely worth it.

If you didn't get to see enough temples, this town is great to explore really amazing ones within a walking distance.

### Tours/Excursions
- Ziplining
- Elephant Sanctuary
- Single/Multi-day treks
- Chiang Rai day trip

### Attractions
- **Old town** 
  The old town in Chiang Mai is surrounded by an old Wall. This old town has great bars, beautiful temples which are in a decent walking distance. This is also a great area for partying and drinking, since there are several bars that are frequented by tourists and locals.
- **Maerim Elephant Sanctuary**
  This was definitely the highlight of my trip and one of my favourite moments in Chiang Mai. These sanctuary houses rescued elephants and tries to give the elephant a really peaceful life after what they have suffered. When booking, pay attention to options labeled "Elephant experience" or such, if possible try to support and book a "Sanctuary". The other options may provide humane elephant experiences but they do not have a Sanctuary affiliation or infrastructure.
  ***IMPORTANT NOTE***: It is crucial to understand the difference between elephant camps and elephant sanctuaries. The former houses elephant tours, activities and even riding, but these also means that the elephants must be "trained" to do so, which involves stabbing and cutting. The latter is the a place where elephant roam almost freely, they provide tours and activities to interact with elephants but only to interact with them, there is no riding, and no painful training for the animal. The elephants in a sanctuary are rescued from places like circus, wood mills and elephant camps, because all these places make them suffer by extreme working conditions or "training". In short, support sanctuaries, not camps.
- **Chiang Rai**
  Another great location to visit. You can find day trips to Chaing Rai with everything included. This excursion is worth it and it explores a few incredible temples outside of the Chiang Mai vicinity, tea fields and other memorable monuments.
- **Night Market**
  The Chiang Mai night market is a beautiful example of the amazing culture and richness you can experience in Thailand. This night market covers a large area of the Old Town and spreads along several streets with all types of vendors and incredible street food.

## Phuket
This is one of the craziest cities I visited. The most popular for sure and always packed with tourists. The scenary in the islands and beaches is trully unforgettable. The weather is amazing and it is a pretty safe area, nothing to worry about. Plenty of local restaurants with GREAT prices and really tasty food. Patong beach is the place to be if you want to party or bar-hop. It is a hub for the tourists and there is always something going on, day or night. It is beside the red light district, so some of that streets can get a little crazy. It is important to keep that in mind if that's something you might not enjoy.

### Tours/Excursions
- The islands are amazing, all tours include lunch in the boat, some cave tours and beach time. Definitely advice doing at least one island.
- Multi-day cruises are an option that I would recommend if you have more time to spend here. 


### Attractions
- **Patong beach**; 
  Great beach close to town with clear water and nice sitting areas.
- **Read Light District** in Patong, the craziness in Patong starts here. Bars, clubs, stripclubs, etc. You can find anything here.
- **Kata Beach**
  Beautiful beach sound og Patong. Known for being a surfing spot. Definitely recommend doing a surfing lesson here if possible.
- **James Bond Island**
  Another very well-known tour.
- **Phi Phi Island**
  This tour is one of the best ones in Phuket. The boat ride might be a bit longer(1.5 hours), but the beaches, snorkling and scenery in general is breath taking. If you only can do 1-island tour, do this one.
- **Coconut Island**
  Island located in the east side of the Phuket region. This island has a few luxury hotels with small beaches and a very chill vibe. These location and hotels are more of an hotel only experience, meaning that the hotels contains all the things to do. IF you want to relax and read at the beach, this might be perfect for you. However, if you prefer excursions, exploring the town, etc; this island will not give you any of that. The island is mainly hotels.

## Krabi
The Krabi region is another excellent destination if you like beaches, nature and fun excursions. I can summarize it as a nice mixture between Chiang Mai and Phuket. Not too crazy nor quiet, its a nice in-between if you want a little of both things and a location that is not as touristy. The Ao Nang(Krabi's town) area has a huge amount of restaurants, stores and tourist centres to find tours. 

*Note*: If you are confortable, you can rent a scooter to get a around. This town doesn't have too much traffic and it might be easier to get around to/from your hotel and the town. Usually around 250-300 Baht per day.

### Attractions
- **Railey Beach**
  This is one of the nicest beaches in this area. Its only accessible by boat. Its a very small island with a few restaurants and a single streach of sand. This is a great place to spend a few hours or the day if you like to chill on the beach. To get to this island, you can purchase a 2-way long boat ticket at Ao Nang beach(usually around 200~ Baht/person), very convenient and affordable.
- **4 Island Tour**
  This is a private long boat that takes you to multiple small islands. This is a very nice tour, it includes a simple lunch and visits very baeutiful islands and includes a snorkling session.

## Koh Samui
Samui is another very popular island with several amazing beaches to visit. You can get to Samui from multiple areas in Thailand since its very popular with tourists. There are lots of things to do in Samui, explored the several beaches in the area, plenty of active tours to do and lots of restaurants and bars to checkout. The nightlife in Chaweng is very active and there are a lot of things to do.

### Attractions
- **Chaweng Beach**
  This beach is the closest to all the restaurants, bars and clubs. The beach is nice but not very quiet, since there are a lot of restaurants with loud music. Its a good place to spend some time if you want to later explore the town, bars or restaurants. This areas is definitely the most lively in Koh Samui. Its very touristy and at night there are plenty of restaurants and bars to go to.

- **Lamai Beach**
  The Lamai is super nice as well, slighly less busy than Chaweng and with plenty of sand. Another great location to spend a day in the beach and relax.

- **Mae Nam beach**
  This beach is the least touristy and most quite of the three listed here. Its the perfect spot if you want a quiet and very relaxing day. This beach a lot less tourist packed than the others ones and also has a few nice restaurants that are very accessible and tasty. This beach was my personal favourite because is more secluded and private.
