# Thailand

Very busy and popular country. Full with tourism and attractions. It is a chaotic but beautiful environment filled with super friendly people, amazing food and fun all around. From street markets, temples, parks, malls, santuaries and floating markets to airplane cementeries, treks and incredible scenery; anyone can find something exciting to do in this beautiful country.

## General information about Thailand

- The details listed in [Asia README](https://github.com/rocajuanma/travel-tips/tree/master/asia) are very relevant and important to keep in mind.
- The country is very safe, traffic is crazy and they drive on the other side of the street so be careful while crossing the street, walking, biking or if you are brave enough; while driving.
- Food is super cheap and extremely tasty. You can find pad thai's at markets for $2 and other dishes that are equally tasty. There are lots of restaurants that vary in price so there is something for everyone.
- I had some issues with ATMs there, but if you face some problems withdrawing money, just try a different 'color' ATM. These ATMs are afiliated to different organizations, only some of them work with international cards. Do not freak out like I did.

## Bangkok
Bangkok is definitely a chaotic beauty. Traffic, lots of people and tourists everywhere, so many fun places to visit and always the classic tuktuk ride to jump on.

### Tours/Excursions
### Attractions
- Soi Cowboy, Bangkok's red light district.
- Khaosan Road, the backpacker's heaven; full of shops, tattoo shops, hostels, bars and clubs. This area changes drastically from day to night. Definitely worth checking out during both times.
- Airplace Cementery, part of a walking tour and a hidden attraction.
- Chatuchak Market, one of the biggest markets in Bangkok. You can find everything and anything in this market. Bring water and confortable shoes, you'll walk a lot!
- Floating Market; there are several in Bangkok, I went to one in the north that you can get to by car. Some other markets you can only get by boat. You can buy local food and treats. The market also provides options for boat rides that are very fun.
- Grand Palance and other temples.


## Chiang Mai
This city was extremely beautiful and full of adventure-like tours. My personal favourite type of excursions. The old town is full of history and places to visit. It has great restaurants and plenty of bars. Massage parlours on every corner with great service for a reasonable price. Getting a Thai Massage(a real massage, not what you are thinking) in one of these places is definitely worth it.

If you didn't get to see enough temples, this town is great to explore really amazing ones within a walking distance.

### Tours/Excursions
- Ziplining
- Elephant Sanctuary
- Single/Multi-day treks

### Attractions
- Old town; the old town in Chiang Mai is surrounded by an old Wall. This old town has great bars, beautiful temples which are in a decent walking distance. This is also a great area for partying and drinking, since there are several bars that are frequented by tourists and locals.
- Elephant Sanctuary; this was definitely the highlight of my trip and one of my favourite moments in Chiang Mai. These sanctuary house rescued elephants and try to give the elephant a really peaceful life after what they have suffered. 
  It is important to understand the difference between elephant camps and elephant sanctuaries. The former houses elephant tours, activities and even riding, but these also means that the elephants must be "trained" to do so, which involves stabbing and cutting. The latter is the a place where elephant roam almost freely, they provide tours and activities to interact with elephants but only to interact with them, there is no riding, and painful training for the animal. The elephants in a sanctuary are rescued from places like circus, wood mills and elephant camps, because all these places make them suffer by extreme working conditions or "training". In short, support sanctuaries, not camps.

## Phuket
This is one of the craziest cities I visited. The most popular for sure and always packed with tourists. The scenary in the islands and beaches is trully unforgettable. The weather is amazing and it is a pretty safe area, nothing to worry about. Plenty of local restaurants with GREAT prices and really tasty food. Patong beach is the place to be if you want to party or bar-hop. It is a hub for the tourists and there is always something going on, day or night. It is beside the red light district, so some of that streets can get a little crazy. It is important to keep that in mind if that's something you might not enjoy.

### Tours/Excursions
- James Bond Island
- Phi Phi Island
- Crabby Island

Notes:
- The islands are amazing, all tours include lunch in the boat, some cave tours and beach time. Definitely advice doing at least one island.
- Multi-day cruises are an option that I would recommend if you have more time to spend here. 


### Attractions
- Patong beach; great beach close to town with clear water and nice sitting areas.
- Read Light District in Patong, the craziness in Patong starts here. Bars, clubs, stripclubs ,etc. You can find anything here.
