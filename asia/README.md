## TIPS
### SIM card
For maps, translations and communication, you should get a local SIM on every country you visit. They are extremely cheap and the plans vary from 3day, 7day, 15days and 1 month prepaid plans. Most of them include unlimited data and minimum call time. However, the data portion is the most important to get around. You can find them in all airports.

Nowadays, there are eSIMs options as well, where you can buy plans for multiple countries in advance and simply install the eSIM in your iPhone or smart phone.

### Negotiation
It is very imporant to negotiate aggressively when purchasing anything in South East Asia. You can ussually get a 50% discount at most local stores or markets. Don't be shy.

### Tuktuk/Taxi fairs
It is key to always agree on a price before getting into a taxi/tuktuk. Sometimes the drivers will get you to the place and increase the price because you are a tourist. Negotiating and agreeing on a price before hand ensure you will not be scammed. Some taxis have a meter, if they do always ensure you ask the driver for the meter fair rather than a fixed price. Some drivers will not want to do it, but stand your ground and if they do not agree, look for another taxi.

### Medications
Vaccination, medicine and antibiotics are very important for a trip like this. Certain areas in South East Asia are of high risk for Malaria and other serious sicknesses. Ensure to do enough research before hand; get all vaccinations in a timely manner and bring all necessary pills to enjoy your time there.
